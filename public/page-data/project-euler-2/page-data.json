I’m energetic, aren’t I?</p>\n<p>Let’s get into problem 2</p>\n<h3>Even Fibonacci numbers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br/>\n1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …<br/>\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As is the pattern with Project Euler, there are a myriad of ways we can solve this problem.</p>\n<p>The Fibonnaci sequence is generally used to teach recursion. Maybe something along the lines of</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\nif (n === 1){\nreturn 1;\n}else{\nreturn fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1);\n}\n}\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>or if you’re fancy:</p>\n<p>{% highlight javascript %}\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\nreturn (n === 1) ? 1 : fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1);\n}\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Ignoring the call stack issues for larger numbers we can solve using setTimeout, retrieving all of the subsequent fibonacci numbers this way seems…inefficient.

Keeping track of the current and previous fibonacci numbers (I love the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> but it just doesn’t cut it here.
