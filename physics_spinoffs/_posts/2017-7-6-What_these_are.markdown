Although I am a fan of experimentation and numbers, sometimes thought experiments are enough to get a point across. These physics posts are the collection of interesting questions I have found on [Physics Stackexchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com).

Generally, they will only be a few lines long, intending to provoke some type of "oh huh, never thought about why that works that way", and they will hopefully be fun and easy to reason out.
